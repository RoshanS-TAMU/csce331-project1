    I competed in the annual NSA Codebreaker challenge, a test of cybersecurity and problem-solving skills for aspiring professionals. As you can see in this writeup, this challenge involved a series of tasks including analyzing network traffic, server log analysis, and decrypting malicious data in email logs.

    With the advent of newer and more advanced AI and machine learning capabilities available at our fingertips, I have been eager to research new ways this technology can be used to make the world a safer place. In 2023, I co-authored this paper analyzing large datasets of financial transactions from major banks and credit card providers, and trained a machine learning model to recognize the differences between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

    WannaCry was one of the most famous and most destructive ransomware attacks in modern history. Believed to originate from the North Korean government, the virus once downloaded will encrypt all files on its host machine, and then generate copies of itself throughout the host network, infecting and destroying more and more devices. In this writeup, I documented a walkthrough of the virus features, from static analysis using tools like CFF Explorer and Ghidra, to dynamic analysis including debugging, and finally running the virus and using a killswitch found in the virus's decompiled code to recover my files from the machine.

    Here are a few other projects, including a CTF (capture the flag) reverse engineering challenge and a web exploitation walkthrough:
