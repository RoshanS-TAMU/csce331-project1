        <h2>Service Activities</h2>
        <p>
            In the summer of 2017 I, along with millions in Houston, were severely impacted by a natural 
disaster the likes of which our city had never experienced before. In a matter of days, Hurricane 
Harvey had left hundreds of homes flooded and damaged millions of dollars’ worth of property. 
In its aftermath, seeing the reports of catastrophic damage, I decided to take a leadership role to 
help the Houston community recover and rebuild in whatever way I could. I reached out to the 
South Houston Sai Center, a religious & service organization, asking how I could work with 
them to assist the relief effort, and was referred to a small effort led by less than 10 dedicated 
volunteers to rebuild and provide food and supplies to one of the hardest-hit neighborhoods in 
Houston, District 148. Due to the small number of volunteers, I had to take on a more active role and lead in 
the relief effort. As part of a team of 3 volunteers, I helped create a database of all the affected 
homes in the neighborhood, the amount and type of damage they had sustained, and the supplies 
each household required. My next task was to go door-to-door and survey each house for 
damage, speak to the families living there and find out their needs first-hand. Seeing these 
people’s heavily damaged homes and hearing about their experiences during Harvey first-hand 
impacted me more than any statistics or news reports, and increased my commitment to this 
effort I had taken an active role in. Over time, more volunteers joined the relief effort and within 
3 months, all the neighborhood’s supply needs were met. I had taken the leadership to play a role 
in helping the Houston community when it needed help most.
