            Howdy! My name is Roshan Sreedhar. I am a class of '25 Aggie, majoring in computer engineering with a minor in cybersecurity.

            Ever since I was a kid, I have always been fascinated with how the computers we use, the phone calls we make to each other, and the internet media we consume from around the world worked, and how we kept those channels safely working. Over time, as I started to learn basic programming and compete in hackathons, I was able to appreciate its importance to virtually every aspect of our lives. Over time, I took those skills I had learned in the classroom to the real world at Intertrust Group and later at the US Air Force.

            When I'm not writing code, I like to read, play tennis, do jiu-jitsu, and write movie reviews.
